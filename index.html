  <h1>Stuff about me</h1>  
  <h2>(Angela Guo)</h2>
  <p>Hi hello!</p>
  <div></div>
  <p>I am a student attending Staten Island Techncical Hignschool. I am really bad at writting about myself, theres not much you should know.</p>
  <div></div>
  <p>In my free time I tend to play games, watch some anime or read manga. One of the manga I read, and my favorite series for over 8 years is "One Piece"!</p>
  <div></div>
  <p>I am also a collector and have probably spent an ungodly amount of money one "One Piece". Although I mainly collect "One Piece" I do also collect manga and merch or other series I like.</p>
  <div></div>
  <p>I could endlessly ramble along about why I love "One Piece" and why it's the greatest show of all time,</p>
